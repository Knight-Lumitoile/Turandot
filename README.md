## Introduction

Turandot is a pure Python application that allows you to create and open encrypted files.

The encryption method employed involves XOR-ing the file content with an input password. The password can consist of any characters, not limited to just letters and numbers. The longer the password, the more robust the encryption becomes.

## Usage

### Home

On the *Home* page, you can choose either to *create* of *open* an encrypted file.

</p>

### Open

On the *Open* page, choose an encrypted file you want to open, enter the password, and click "Open." The decrypted file will open, allowing you to make modifications. After completing the modifications, return to ***Turandot***, and click "Save" - now the file you just modified will be encrypted and saved.

The original encrypted file will be moved to the Recycle Bin as a backup.
